## What we are going to build

This repo contains the Rick and Morty in React exercise. Use this as a template.

We will create a React app to render characters from the Rick and Morty API. You will be able to save characters as favorites, see detailed information on a separate page and you can get random characters.

See a scribble for a simple overview:
